    <p>Dataforge is an ever growing project. My environment didnâ€™t get a name until I discovered the tildeverse, and met Cameron Kaiser
who similarly calls his environment <a href="https://floodgap.com">Floodgap</a>. I was really inspired to give my computing environment a face and a name, 
just like Cameron had done with his lab full of PowerPC machines and other PPC miscellany. Though, Silicon Graphics is more my retro flavor.</p>
<p>
I started off meagerly with just my laptop and an old HP desktop which now serves as part of my Kubernetes cluster, and over time I've added an SGI here, a Raspberry Pi there. Another machine. Always another machine. Once you get into the home lab biz, it becomes an addiction and you're constantly trying to grow things, upgrade things and make things cooler.

I remember the Internet circa 1998 where self-hosting things was very common. This was before the plethora of cloud hosting solutions came onto the scene. In fact,
everyone small and big self-hosted. And even though we have all these marvelous cloud services like AWS, there will always been something quaint and DIY about self-hosting. As there are more and more grave abuses of privacy and censorship on the modern web, I hope I can encourage people to take the DIY self-hosting route.
