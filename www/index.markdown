<h3>Oh. Hai! You found me!</h3>
<p>
Welcome to my little corner of the wide web! I'm your prime deviant, Wesley (aka; Praetor as most of y'all know me).
You've stumbled upon the page to my personal lab, where magical and mystical things happen. I'm a systems engineer backed
by 25 years of experience. If you're interested in learning about me professionally, 
head on over to my <a href="https://gwesfisher.github.io">professional site</a>.
<p>
My interests are focused around retrocomputing and digital art. I'm a collector of Silicon Graphics machines, which is my
M.O :p If you <i>really</i> want to jump down the rabbit hole, you can go to my <a href="https://tilde.team/~praetor">personal</a> site
where anything goes!!
